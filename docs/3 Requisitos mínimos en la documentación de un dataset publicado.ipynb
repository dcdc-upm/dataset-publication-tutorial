    "# Requisitos mínimos en la documentación de un dataset publicado\n",
    "\n",
    "En este notebook se describirán aquellos principios y elementos indispensables en la publicación de un recurso en abierto (en este caso un dataset, pero los mismos requisitos pueden aplicarse a otros recursos). Primero, profundizaremos en los principios mínimos que hay que considerar y, después, en los detalles que han de incluirse en la documentación del dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principios mínimos\n",
    "\n",
    "Siguiendo los principios FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability), los requisitos mínimos que se exigen para considerar al recurso como FAIR son los siguientes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Findability:\n",
    "- Metadatos ricos y descriptivos.\n",
    "- Documentación clara de la fuente de los datos y la metodología de extracción de estos.\n",
    "- Identificador persistente asignado al recurso (DOI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessibility:\n",
    "- Instrucciones detalladas de como acceder al recurso.\n",
    "- Utilizar plataformas de acceso abierto para alojar los recursos.\n",
    "- Proveer los datos en formatos accesibles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interoperability:\n",
    "- Utilizar formatos de datos reconocidos por la comunidad.\n",
    "- Utilizar estándares para el intercambio de datos (reusar estructuras de datos de la comunidad).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability:\n",
    "- Proporcionar información detallada sobre la procedencia (provenance) y las condiciones de recolección de los datos para que otros usuarios puedan replicar y adaptar los datos.\n",
    "- Versionar el recurso para mantener un registros de cambios y asegurar la trazabilidad.\n",
    "- Cumplimiento de estándares éticos y legales (privacidad, GDPR, etc.)\n",
    "- Incluir licencias claras que definan los derechos de uso (ej. Creative Commons).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentación mínima\n",
    "\n",
    "Seguir los principios FAIR requiere comprometerse con principios cualitativos que son más complicados de evaluar que otros. Estos principios sobre todo son aquellos que hacen referencia a generar metadatos y documentación. Para facilitar esta tarea y establecer un estándard de calidad el contenido mínimo que ha de aparecer en la documentación del recurso ha de ser el siguiente: Resumen del recurso, Cómo utilizar el recurso, Detalles del recurso (estructura, proceso de recolección, procesamiento y mantenimiento de los datos), Licencia del recurso, Citación y atribución, Agradecimientos.\n",
    "\n",

    "    6. How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?\n",
    "    7. Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).\n",

    "    21. How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/ derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.\n",
    "    22. What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?\n",
    "    23. If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?\n",
